I like [this shader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/flc3Rn) from shadertoy. I think it runs suprisingly well, considering the visuals and the limitations imposed by the website. It doesn't look like the terrain heightmap is fully procedural, but the compressed data is still relatively small compared to some other shadertoys ive seen.
