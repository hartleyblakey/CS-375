I chose [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com) as my example of a website that utilizes webGL. I love the idea of people trying to create the best things they can within the limitations of the site. More practically, it serves as a repository of shader code for other people to use or study.

In case I needed to provide a specific shader, I like [this one](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/flc3Rn) even though the terrain is not really procedural.
