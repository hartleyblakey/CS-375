I like [this project](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/flc3Rn) from shadertoy. I think it runs surprisingly well, considering the visuals and the limitations imposed by the website. It doesn't look like the terrain heightmap is fully procedural, but the compressed data is small enough that it still loads relatively quickly. I also like Davidar's terrain generation shaders, which are combined into one project [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XttcWn).
